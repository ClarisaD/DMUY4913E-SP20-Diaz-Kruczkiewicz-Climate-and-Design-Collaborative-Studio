## Final Project

Continue research, analyze, evaluate, and communicate the research & design for a proposal to adapt to dzuds in Mongolia. The final result is presentation of visuals showing the project and scenarios in which it exists, a systems map of your proposal including stakeholders, and a tool or multiple tools that will execute the proposal's plan.  Working in pairs virtually during COVID-19 will only be permitted with approval from instructors, where we review your project plan for virutal meetings and division of work. This must be approved by Wednesday, April 8, 2020.

### Annotated Bibliography

You will write an annotated bibliography as a team. We recommend using google docs to collaboratively write. The bare minimum of sources is ten. You will be graded based on the thoroughness of your research. You should have many different types of sources in your bibliography. These sources should have an impact on the work you create.

Using [Purdue OWL Annotated Bibliography Guidelines](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/614/01/), summarize, assess, and reflect.

* The Wikipedia Disclaimer: Nowadays, wikipedia is often the starting point for research – it’s quick, easy, and provides an acceptable overview of many subjects. However, for serious, sustained research Wikipedia should not be relied upon as a primary source. Use Wikipedia to familiarize yourself with your subject and to locate other sources for further research.
