## Welcome to the Climate & Design Collaborative Studio!

Students in this course will explore the challenges of the human impact of climate change by thinking and working through a real-life case study. Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is selected as a location of rapid urban change and more frequent flooding. Using background information provided by the course partner, Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, students will study how the city has evolved, the current social and climate related stressors, and what needs may be present in communities that live there. 

The course will be studio based, creating a series of assignments and projects that explore questions like: How would residents receive communication of approaching storms? How could the city develop protection from floods? How might someone get food when the streets are uninhabitable? Questions explored through projects are open to student interest based on their investigations. 

The end result of the course is to gain a better understanding of macro and micro issues at hand when it comes to climate change solutions and the various people that need them. Students will come away with having explored the role integrated media and technology plays in addressing the issues of adapting to climate change. Similarities and differences between ideas for urban spaces in Dar es Salaam may also be compared to other cities, like New York City.  


Prerequisite: None

### PROGRAM GOALS

The following Integrated Digital Media program goals are introduced and reinforced within this course. Students will:

* develop conceptual thinking skills about designing within the constraints of climate change to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
* develop a line of thought related to adapting to climate change through inquiry and iteration.
* develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historical, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.


### COURSE GOALS

To get students to, all in the context of how design relates to the climate:

* develop a rigorous, iterative process for looking, questioning, thinking, making, and communicating that challenges assumptions and preconceived ideas about how to communicate climate risk
* use their imagination to create something entirely new & innovative OR to reinvent an old idea into something new to communicate climate risk
* introduce students to the many research & design and science methodologies available to them
* develop skills of description, research, analysis, visualization, design and critical thinking.
* improve writing, documentation, and presentation skills
* facilitate collaboration

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this course students should be able to:

* identify who is affected by climate change, in particular who's involved in flood risk communication
* understand macro systemic issues of communicating risk and spot where they may be faulty
* understand micro issues of developing tools to communicate climate risk

### COURSE STRUCTURE

The course will be comprised of lectures, critiques, discussions, readings, screenings, exercises, projects, and a collaborative research paper.

Critiques are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. The class analyzes and suggests ways to increase the impact of your project. Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your critique notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand what you are doing to make your project better. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project.

Rules of the Critique:

* Be Present and Engaged
* Give Feedback to your classmates
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

There will be discrete team and individual exercises and projects that require you to apply the tools, techniques, and methods presented in the lectures, discussions, readings, and other material. These fundamentals are organized according to five phases:

**Phase 1: Discovery / Inspiration**

* Research into climate change topics and the Dar es Salaam site

**Phase 2: Research / Ideation / Brainstorming**

* Asking and listening
* Visual researching
* Materials researching
* User / audience researching and ethnographic researching
* Systems researching
* Activity researching
* Primary researching
* Scholarly researching
* Brainstorming, gamestorming, ideation

**Phase 3: Design / Sketching / Mapping**

* Visualizing, drawing, sketching
* Planning and mapping
* Grouping, clustering, comparing, contrasting
* Organizing and designing
* Reorganizing and redesigning
* Shaping and forming
* Discerning and revealing
* Connecting and disconnecting

**Phase 4: Prototyping**

* Making, building, creating
* Rapid prototyping
* Iterating
* Selecting and editing
* Breaking then repeating all of the above

**Phase 5: Positioning / Pitching**

* Framing and positioning
* Storytelling, engaging, communicating, selling

Students will conduct self assessments as well as be evaluated by the professors during or after midterm and at the end of the semester. Any action without reflection is meaningless. Real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything. It involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something.

### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Schedule your time \(keep a calendar of some sort\) 
* Come to class on time and participate \(be present and engaged\)
* Study outside of class \(ideally with classmate\(s\)
* Devote at a minimum 4 to 8 hours per week outside of class, fulfilling homework assignments, reading, and studying concepts covered in class.
* Complete all assignments by due dates
* Acquire and read all assigned readings before they are due
* Action – do your absolute best
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Talk to one of us in person about issues and problems. \(if your email turns into a paragraph or two that means you should be talking to one of us in person, not emailing us.\)
* Have desire amounting to enthusiasm \(to learn, to explore\)
* Have patience, persistence, and discipline 
* Be creative
* Pay attention to detail & craft
* Have self-confidence and pride in your work
* Take risks & be fearless in your projects
* Have fun!

### EVALUATION & GRADING

**Attendance**

* Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of every class. Since there is so much technical, conceptual, science, and design information to absorb, regular attendance is essential.
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent \(1/2 a grade point \(e.g. A to an A-\)\) for each additional absence.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.625 percent
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class \(in person or via email\).
* Attendance is mandatory for the midterm and final presentations / critiques.

#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:

* Makeup assignments are only available when discussed with and approved by the instructor in advance of the due date.
* Each student will be judged on the commitment, fearlessness, and continuous improvement that their work shows. Incomplete or unsatisfactory work will receive a failing grade.

**Quantitative Grading Overview**

* 5% Class Participation
* 5% [Self Assessments](assignments/self-assessments.md) \(2.5% each\)
* 20% [Class Assignments on Blog](assignments/)
* 30% [Midterm Project & Annnotated Bibliography](projects/midterm-project.md)
* 40% [Final Project & Annotated Bibliography](projects/final-project.md)

### TECHNOLOGY USE IN THE CLASSROOM

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for artists, designers, and students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting, especially in the classroom. When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, doing VFS homework, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, etc. Also, during class screenings, your laptops should not be used.

### ACADEMIC HONESTY

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA style for citing and documenting source material.
